## What I am doing?
* I have tied up scores and have aggregated them into one file
* Finished collecting all subreddit information which have appeared in my database
* I need to add both of these to the database, tidy up the datbase
* I need to ask Marija **how** I should organise my code base and how I should present it, because at the minute it is quite disparate and spread out.
Also I probably won't have as much code as most people- should ask what I should do about that.

### Old Code
* I have since found that I did something poorly very early in the project, I could change it to be much cleaner however this mistake lead me to a script I spent a long time on.
I must ask Marija is it better to fix this script to how it should have been or to leave it so my longer script makes sense.
    * I suppose the data is all there so it will make sense one way or another
